## TP 3 Notes


- In this part of Exercise 1, we learned how to initialize and manage scene objects and materials. We created instances of the Tangram and Unit Cube, defined materials with elevated specular components, and configured the GUI to control object selection and material properties.

- In this part of Exercise 1, we learned how to define individual materials and apply them to different shapes within the Tangram.

In part 2, in step 7 by defining normals perpendicular to each face of the prism and assigning a distinct set of vertices to each face, the resulting lighting calculation will resemble the effect produced by "Constant Shading."

This happens because each face will have a consistent and independent normal, unaffected by the normals of adjacent faces. As a result, the lighting will appear uniform across each face, without a smooth transition between neighboring faces â€” exactly like "Constant Shading," where the light intensity is calculated based solely on the orientation of each face and applied uniformly across its entire surface.

- In this exercise we had some doubts in the orientation of the prism since in step 8 we are asked to position the prism in a vertical column, but in step 9 we are referred to the images, and they have a different orientation.

- In this part, we created a cylinder-like shape using shared vertices and smooth shading using normals.
