## TP 2 Notes


- In exercise 2, we accurately positioned each tangram piece. We applied translate, rotate, and scale operations, isolating each transformation with pushMatrix and popMatrix. Our goal was to recreate a composite tangram figure centered at the origin, demonstrating clear and precise geometric manipulation.

- For task 3, we developed a unit cube centered at the origin, with vertices ranging from -0.5 to 0.5. We defined the eight vertices and established the face connectivity to form a single mesh of triangles. We then integrated the cube into the scene as a base behind the tangram, showcasing our skills in 3D geometric transformations.

- In exercise 4, we built a unit cube by composing multiple planar faces. We developed a MyQuad class representing a unit square and then created MyUnitCubeQuad by reusing a single quad instance for all six faces through appropriate translations and rotations. This modular approach helped us practice transformation matrices and object composition in WebCGF, leading to an efficient and clean solution.
