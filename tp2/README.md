## TP 2 Notes


- In exercise 2, we accurately positioned each tangram piece. We applied translate, rotate, and scale operations, isolating each transformation with pushMatrix and popMatrix. Our goal was to recreate a composite tangram figure centered at the origin, demonstrating clear and precise geometric manipulation.

- For task 3, we developed a unit cube centered at the origin, with vertices ranging from -0.5 to 0.5. We defined the eight vertices and established the face connectivity to form a single mesh of triangles. We then integrated the cube into the scene as a base behind the tangram, showcasing our skills in 3D geometric transformations.
